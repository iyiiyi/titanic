This is my 1st ML practice with kaggle Titanic at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Here, I wanted to do quick and simple coding with applying limited ML knowledge. Somehow, after 6 hours of work, I could code and run my very first ML model using LogisticRegression of which accuracy came up with > 96% 
Wow! haha..

I hope I get insight of seeing and choosing features and get back to this challenge and build better model. Maybe with more advanced challenges in Kaggle.
